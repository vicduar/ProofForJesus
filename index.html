            <span class="font">God. Jesus. The Holy Spirit.</span><span class="reverse">What are these names and what do they mean? Over the length of this webpage the goal is for all of your questions to be answered, and then maybe some you haven't ever thought to ask. A good place to start is describing what the three entities of God are, as stated above...God, Jesus, and The Holy Spirit. The three entities together are what is known as<i>"The Holy Trinity"</i>, or <i>"Trinity"</i>, for short. The Trinity is one entity (God) in his different forms. Wait! Huh? What do you mean God is made up of three things? How can one be three? Whoa! Alright, alright, let's slow it down so you can catch up. To explain, let's start with one piece of the Holy Trinity: God. <img class="trees" src="img\trees.png">God is the creator of the universe, which includes all things we know: the trees, the animals, the oceans, the stars, the planets, and you and I, to name but a few.</span>
        </p><br>
        
        
    
        <p>Then, approximately 2000 years ago, God felt the need to interact with his children (our ancestors) here on earth and so made himself into a man. This man's name is Jesus. Jesus was born by immaculate conception of his mother, the Virgin Mary. What does this mean you ask? Well, when God decided to form himself into a man he placed the cellular components necessary to make a baby directly into Mary's womb. There was no physical contact between Mary or Joseph. Instead, it was done by God's will.<img class="sun" src="img\GodSun.png"></p><br>
            
        <p>The last entity, then, is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is God in spiritual form; the form that lives within us and creates a guide for us to understand what is right and wrong. The Holy Spirit helps us to find good morals to abide by in our lives. <img class="dove" src="img\Dove.png" alt="Dove">That is, should we be open to him doing so. God does not force himself upon anyone. Only those with the desire to come to know and accept him into their lives will be filled with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is commonly represented as a Dove.</p><br>

        

        <p>Now that we have a basic definition for each, lets move on to understanding how God acts in our lives and, more importantly, what God expects from each of us as we progress through life.</p><br>

        <p>First, to understand how God acts in our lives we must recall, as discussed above, that God exists as three entities. The entity that acts in our lives here on earth is the Holy Spirit. According to (1 Corinthians 3:16), the body of faithful Christians becomes His temple. With this in mind, the roles the Holy Spirit take on in our lives can be described as:</p>

                <img class="trinity" src="img\holy-trinity-clipart.png" alt="Holy Trinity Diagram">
                <li>Comforter/Advocate/Helper - In times of trouble or need, the Holy Spirit is believed to come alongside believers to provide assistance, guidance, strength, and support.</li>
                <li>Teacher/Guide - The Holy Spirit is believed to teach and guide believers in understanding and living out the teachings of Jesus Christ.</li>
                <li>Conviction of Sin - The Holy Spirit is often seen as convicting individuals of their sinfulness, leading them to repentance and a turning towards God.</li>
                <li>Empowerer - The Holy Spirit is considered to empower believers for Christian living, equipping them with spiritual gifts for service and enabling them to live according to God's will.</li>
            </ol><br><br>

            <p>You are likely saying to yourself: Ok! Ok! I understand all this but what does it mean? What is it that God expects from me after learning all of this?! Well, to put is simply, God expects you to abide by his rules. What rules you say? You can start with the Ten Commandments found in (Exodus 20).</p>

            <p>Although they are much self explanatory, we'll explain each just for good measure - since it is so important that you understand exactly how to abide by them. </p>
