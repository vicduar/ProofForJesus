        <p class="font">God. Jesus. The Holy Spirit.<class="reverse"> These three entities together are what is known as<i>The Holy Trinity.</i> But, what exactly does this mean? Well...God is the creator of all things we know: the trees, the animals, the oceans, the stars, the planets, and you and I.</p>
        
        <p>Then, approximately 2000 years ago, God felt the need to interact with his children (our ancestors) here on earth and so made himself into a man. This man's name was/is Jesus. The last entity, then, is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is God in spiritual form; the form that lives within us and creates a guide for understanding what is right and wrong, and helps us to find good morals to abide by in our lives. That is, should we be open to him doing so. God does not force himself upon anyone. Only those with the desire to come to know and accept go into their lives will be filled with the Holy Spirit.</p><br></br>
