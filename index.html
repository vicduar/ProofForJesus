            <span class="font">God. Jesus. The Holy Spirit.</span><span class="reverse">What are these names and what do they mean? Well, these three entities together are what is known as<i>"The Holy Trinity"</i>, or <i>"Trinity"</i>, for short. The Trinity is one entity (God) in his different forms. Wait! Huh? What do you mean God is made up of three things? How can one be three? Whoa! Alright, alright, let's slow it down so you can catch up. To explain, let's start with one piece of the Holy Trinity: God. <img class="trees" src="img\trees.png">God is the creator of the universe, which includes all things we know: the trees, the animals, the oceans, the stars, the planets, and you and I, to name a few.</span>
        </p><br>
        
    
    
        <p>Then, approximately 2000 years ago, God felt the need to interact with his children (our ancestors) here on earth and so made himself into a man. This man's name is Jesus. Jesus was born by immaculate conception of his mother, the Virgin Mary.<img class="sun" src="img\GodSun.png"></p><br>
            
        <p>The last entity, then, is the Holy Spirit.The Holy Spirit is God in spiritual form; the form that lives within us and creates a guide for us to understand what is right and wrong. The Holy Spirit helps us to find good morals to abide by in our lives. <img class="dove" src="img\Dove.png" alt="Dove">That is, should we be open to him doing so. God does not force himself upon anyone. Only those with the desire to come to know and accept him into their lives will be filled with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is commonly signified using a Dove.</p><br>

        

        <p>Now that we have a basic definition for each, lets move on to understanding**********</p><br>
