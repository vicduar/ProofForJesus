            <span class="font">God. Jesus. The Holy Spirit.</span><span class="reverse">What are these names and what do they mean? Over the length of this webpage the goal is for all of your questions to be answered, and then maybe some you haven't ever thought to ask. A good place to start is describing what the three entities of God are, as stated above...God, Jesus, and The Holy Spirit. The three entities together are what is known as<i>"The Holy Trinity"</i>, or <i>"Trinity"</i>, for short. The Trinity is one entity (God) in his different forms. Wait! Huh? What do you mean God is made up of three things? How can one be three? Whoa! Alright, alright, let's slow it down so you can catch up. To explain, let's start with one piece of the Holy Trinity: God. <img class="trees" src="img\trees.png">God is the creator of the universe, which includes all things we know: the trees, the animals, the oceans, the stars, the planets, and you and I, to name but a few.</span>
        </p><br>
        
        
    
        <p>Then, approximately 2000 years ago, God felt the need to interact with his children (our ancestors) here on earth and so made himself into a man. This man's name is Jesus. Jesus was born by immaculate conception of his mother, the Virgin Mary. What does this mean you ask? Well, when God decided to form himself into a man he placed the cellular components necessary to make a baby directly into Mary's womb. There was no physical contact between Mary or Joseph. Instead, it was done by God's will and the Holy Spirit.<img class="sun" src="img\GodSun.png"></p><br>
            
        <p>The last entity, then, is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is God in spiritual form; the form that lives within us and creates a guide for us to understand what is right and wrong. The Holy Spirit helps us to find good morals to abide by in our lives. <img class="dove" src="img\Dove.png" alt="Dove">That is, should we be open to him doing so. God does not force himself upon anyone. Only those with the desire to come to know and accept him into their lives will be filled with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is commonly represented as a Dove.</p><br>

        

        <p>Now that we have a basic definition for each, lets move on to understanding how God acts in our lives and, more importantly, what God expects from each of us as we progress through life. To understand how God acts in our lives we must recall, as discussed above, that God exists as three entities. The entity that acts in our lives here on earth is the Holy Spirit. According to (1 Corinthians 3:16), the body of faithful Christians becomes His temple. With this in mind, the roles the Holy Spirit take on in our lives can be described as:</p>

            <ol class="bullet">
                <img class="trinity" src="img\holy-trinity-clipart.png" alt="Holy Trinity Diagram">
                <li>Comforter/Advocate/Helper - In times of trouble or need, the Holy Spirit is believed to come alongside believers to provide assistance, guidance, strength, and support.</li>
                <li>Teacher/Guide - The Holy Spirit is believed to teach and guide believers in understanding and living out the teachings of Jesus Christ.</li>
                <li>Conviction of Sin - The Holy Spirit is often seen as convicting individuals of their sinfulness, leading them to repentance and a turning towards God.</li>
                <li>Empowerer - The Holy Spirit is considered to empower believers for Christian living, equipping them with spiritual gifts for service and enabling them to live according to God's will.</li>
            </ol><br><br>

            <p>You are likely saying to yourself: Ok! Ok! I understand all this but what does it mean? What is it that God expects from me after learning all of this?! Well, to put is simply, God expects you to abide by his rules. What rules? A good place to start is with the Ten Commandments:</p>
            
                <img class="command" src="img\ten-commandments.png" alt="Ten Commandments on two slates."><br>

            <p>Why do you suppose they are pictured here as written on stone tablets? That's because these commandments were given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai, as stated in (Exodus 20) of the Bible. Back in Moses' time, there was no paper. Etching on stone tables was the only way of taking notes! Once you have run your life with the Ten Commandments as your guide, you will be living as Jesus did. This is the goal for all humankind; to follow in Jesus' footsteps when he was on earth more than 2,000 years ago. Do you remember what you learned about Jesus and that he is one piece of the Holy Trinity? To remind you: Jesus is the part of the Trinity that is God in human form. His mother is the Virgin Mary (known by many other names as well) and his father is St. Joseph.</p><br>

            <p>While Jesus was on earth, he was a teacher of all things holy. He lived as the example of how humankind should live themselves. He also performed many miracles such as turning water into wine (his first miracle) and healing the sick. He called himself the Son of the Father in heaven, the "Resurrection and the Life" (John 11:25), the "Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End" (Rev 22:13), among many others. See <a href="https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/bible-study/50-names-of-jesus-who-the-bible-says-christ-is.html">this website</a> for a more comprehensive listing of all the names for Jesus.</p><br>

            <p>Now that you have an understanding of the basics, let's move on to the important topics that were meant to be discussed on this webpage. After reading what has been written thus far on this webpage, you know who Jesus is. However, there are many who don't believe that Jesus existed, or even if he did, he was not the messiah. My job herein is to prove to you that Jesus is real, he did exist, and he is the Messiah. My job is to provide you with "Proof...for...Jesus."</p><br>
